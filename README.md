- Invoking JavaScript functions with "onclick" html button attribute
- Implementing "textContent" and "getElementById" to manipulate the DOM and alter html content 
- Using Math.floor() and Math.random() functions to generate an integer that will function as random index point
- Iterating through array using For Loop to apply Math object functions until desired length is reached
